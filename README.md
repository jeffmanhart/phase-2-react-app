This project was built using the create react app templates.  This will allow users to find an idea for an activity to do when they are feeling bored.  Leveraging the Boredapi.com I am fetching random ideas or allowing users to search for more specific ideas.
The Api will return and activity, the potential price, number of ideal participants, any links if available, and a category for the activity.
